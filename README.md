Problem-solving in JavaScript, particularly when targeting an advanced level like "Level 100.js," involves mastering both the fundamentals and advanced concepts of the language. It requires proficiency in breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts and leveraging JavaScript's features to build efficient, scalable solutions. Key skills include working with data structures like arrays, objects, and maps, as well as mastering algorithms for sorting, searching, and optimization. Understanding asynchronous programming with promises and async/await, handling DOM manipulations, and using modern ES6+ features such as destructuring, spread operators, and arrow functions are essential. Additionally, problem-solving at this level demands familiarity with debugging tools, writing clean, modular code, and optimizing performance. Practicing coding challenges, real-world scenarios, and system design problems further sharpens these skills. The goal is not only to solve problems but to do so with clarity, efficiency, and a deep understanding of the underlying concepts.
